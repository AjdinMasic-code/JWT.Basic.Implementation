# JWT.Basic.Implementation Using C#
If you are using Rider or Visual Studio you will need to run the JWT.Authentication.And.API.Callers and API projects at the same time in order to test. You can use docker w/ Kubernetes to deploy both outside of IDE however, outside of the scope of this project.

The application tests a failure path (not authorized) and a success path generating a token and sending a request to protected endpoint.
